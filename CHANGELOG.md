## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`REMEMBER_BRANCH` env var override** — `scripts/save-session.sh` now honors `$REMEMBER_BRANCH` when computing the `## HH:MM | <branch>` identity slot of each daily-log entry. Falls back to the existing `git branch --show-current` lookup, then the literal `"unknown"` if no git repo is present. Use case: running Claude Code from `$HOME` (or any non-git directory) collapses the identity slot to `unknown` on every entry, which makes log entries indistinguishable across instances. Export `REMEMBER_BRANCH=laptop` / `cloud` / `staging` / `$HOSTNAME` in your shell rc and the slot becomes a useful per-instance tag. Documented in `README.md` Configuration → Environment variables.

### Fixed

- **`--max-turns 1` broke the save on Claude Code 2.1.x** ([#98](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/98), [#100](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/100)) — CC 2.x counts prompt-delivery as turn 1, so the nested `claude -p` summarizer exited `error_max_turns` before the model replied; `save-session.sh` treated the non-zero exit as fatal and never wrote memory (and re-fired on nearly every tool call). `--max-turns` is now configurable via `REMEMBER_MAX_TURNS` (default 4, validated to `[1, 20]`); a user Stop hook eats an extra turn, hence the margin. Reported by [@davidomisi](https://github.com/davidomisi) and [@NORSAIN-AI](https://github.com/NORSAIN-AI).
- **Single `claude -p` call site** ([#94](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/94)) — the summarizer invocation lived in two drifted places (`save-session.sh` inlined it twice; `pipeline/haiku.py` had `call_haiku`). Unified on `pipeline/haiku.py` via a new `pipeline.shell call-haiku` subcommand; `save-session.sh` delegates both calls. Closes the drift where `haiku.py` was missing `--mcp-config` / `--strict-mcp-config`.
- **Summarizer subprocess flooded `~/.claude/projects/`** ([#87](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/87)) — the nested `claude -p` now runs with `--no-session-persistence` and `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections`, so it no longer writes a resumable session record per call (hundreds/day on busy sessions). Community contribution by [@sergeclaesen](https://github.com/sergeclaesen).
- **Consolidation wrote conversational replies as memory** ([#89](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/89)) — a SKIP or non-conforming Haiku response is now rejected (`ConsolidationSkipped`) instead of being written to `recent.md`/`archive.md` and irreversibly retiring the staging files. Community contribution by [@Buzzwoo-Ecom-Team](https://github.com/Buzzwoo-Ecom-Team).
- **Empty timezone resolved to UTC instead of system-local** ([#99](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/pull/99)) — date calls now route through the `_remember_date` helper, so an unset `REMEMBER_TZ` falls back to system-local rather than a bare `TZ=""` (UTC) for users west of UTC. Community contribution by [@kristian-presso](https://github.com/kristian-presso).
- **Windows: mojibake and lone-surrogate save crash** ([#91](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/91), [#97](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/97)) — the stdin pipe and the `claude` subprocess decoded with the locale codec (cp1252) instead of UTF-8, corrupting `→`/`—` into mojibake and crashing every autosave on lone surrogates. Audited **every** byte↔str boundary: explicit `encoding="utf-8"` on the stdin pipe and subprocess; `errors="replace"` on text writes and user-editable memory-file/transcript reads (never crash a save on a hand-edited byte); `surrogatepass` on the staging-paths filename encode; machine-written JSON (`last-save.json`) kept strict. Reported by [@marketechniks](https://github.com/marketechniks) and [@DogmaLabsTech](https://github.com/DogmaLabsTech).

- **Windows external-mode `data_dir` path doubling** ([#79](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/79)) — `lib-memory-dir.sh` only recognized `/…` and `~…` as absolute when resolving `REMEMBER_DIR` from a `data_dir`, so a Windows drive path (`C:/Users/…/mem/{slug}`) fell through to the relative branch and was prepended to `PROJECT_DIR` — `REMEMBER_DIR` became `…/proj/C:/…` and `{slug}` was never substituted (substitution lives only in the absolute branch). Drive-letter forms (`C:/…` and `C:\…`) are now recognized as absolute. Surfaced by re-enabling the Windows shell tests (#79).

### Security

- **Nested `claude -p` leaked the parent Claude Code session env** ([#95](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/95)) — the subprocess stripped only `CLAUDECODE`, so `CLAUDE_JOB_DIR` and the `CLAUDE_CODE_*` family (e.g. `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`) were inherited, making the child look like the parent's resumable session to anything keying off those vars. `_child_env()` now strips `CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_JOB_DIR`, and all `CLAUDE_CODE_*`. Reported by [@FrankLedo](https://github.com/FrankLedo).

### Tests

- New `tests/test_save_session_branch_override.py` — pins the four-case truth table for the `BRANCH=` line in `save-session.sh`: env-set + git-repo (env wins), env-unset + git-repo (git wins), env-unset + no-git (`unknown` fallback), env-set-to-empty + no-git (`:-` treats empty as unset, falls back to `unknown`). Snapshots the line out of the live `save-session.sh` rather than re-asserting a copy, so the test fails loudly if the line is ever edited without updating the test.
- New `tests/test_encoding_boundaries.py` — exercises the real byte↔str boundaries under a forced non-UTF-8 locale (`PYTHONUTF8=0 PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=0 LC_ALL=C`) so the mojibake/surrogate bugs reproduce on the Linux/macOS CI legs too — the boundary-blindness (every test mocked `StringIO` stdin / `MagicMock` subprocess) is why the green Windows matrix never caught them.
- **Re-enabled Windows shell-subprocess coverage** ([#79](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/79)) — `test_log_sh`, `test_migration`, and `test_security_fixes` were `skipif(win32)`. Three layers: (1) tests invoke bash by its explicit Git-for-Windows path — `subprocess.run(["bash", …])` on Windows hits `System32\bash.exe` (the WSL launcher) first because `CreateProcess` searches System32 before PATH, so no PATH trick works; (2) Windows paths injected into bash scripts are normalized to forward-slash drive form (`C:\x` → `C:/x`) and quoted — forward-slash works for both Git Bash and the Windows `python3` the scripts invoke, where the MSYS `/c/x` form does not; (3) the real bug those tests caught (see Fixed → `lib-memory-dir.sh`). `TestDispatchOwnershipChecks` stays skipped on Windows (POSIX ownership/world-writable bits don't map to NTFS).

## [0.7.3] — Windows save pipeline shell↔Python bridge

### Fixed

- **Save pipeline broken on Windows / Git Bash** ([#84](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/84)) — the shell↔Python bridge had two mismatched halves: `pipeline.shell._shell_escape` single-quote-wrapped values per POSIX `eval` convention, but `safe_eval` in `scripts/log.sh` assigned verbatim via `printf -v` (no shell expansion). On Linux, temp paths contain no shell-unsafe chars so the escaper returned them unquoted — invisible. On Windows, backslash paths got quoted, then stored with literal quotes, then `open()` failed with `OSError: [Errno 22]`. Plus `safe_eval` did not strip CR, so Python's `\r\n` line endings on Windows corrupted integer values and broke `[ -eq ]` tests in `save-session.sh`. Fix: `_shell_escape` now emits verbatim (raises on newline); `safe_eval` strips trailing `\r`; redundant override in `detect-tools.sh` removed (`log.sh` is single source of truth). Issue reported by [@qzftsh7f44-design](https://github.com/qzftsh7f44-design).

### Tests

- New `tests/test_safe_eval_seam.py` pins the Python↔bash roundtrip contract — parametrized across Linux paths, Windows backslash paths, spaces, single quotes. Closes the seam gap CI was blind to (both sides were unit-tested in isolation, never together).
- 391 tests, 99% coverage.

## [0.7.1] — Windows portability fixes

### Fixed

- **SessionStart hook libuv assertion on Windows** ([#39](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/pull/39)) — backgrounded `save-session.sh` and `run-consolidation.sh` now fully detach via `</dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown`, preventing the `UV_HANDLE_CLOSING` assertion that surfaced as `SessionStart:startup hook error` on every fresh terminal. Community contribution by [@maxwellkemp10-ux](https://github.com/maxwellkemp10-ux).
- **Silent save failures on Windows + Git Bash** ([#44](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/pull/44)) — Git Bash exposes `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` as a POSIX path (`/c/Users/...`), but Claude Code stores sessions under the Win32-form slug (`C--Users-...`). The post-tool hook silently exited because the slug never matched. `resolve-paths.sh` now normalizes the POSIX form to Win32 inside an `OSTYPE`-gated case (no-op on Linux/macOS). Community contribution by [@kanelavish-a11y](https://github.com/kanelavish-a11y).

### Tests

- 327 tests (up from 323).

## [0.7.0] — Unified config reader, marketplace path fix

### Fixed

- **Unified config reader across all scripts** ([#38](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/pull/38)) — all scripts now use `config()` from `log.sh` instead of separate readers; `PIPELINE_DIR` set with fallback for both marketplace and local installs. Issue reported by [@josemoreno801-netizen](https://github.com/josemoreno801-netizen).
- **`user-prompt-hook.sh` sources `resolve-paths.sh`** — was the root cause of marketplace config path failures.
- **Removed redundant `REMEMBER_TZ` re-reads** — timezone is now set once in `log.sh`, inherited by all scripts.
- **Removed duplicate `cfg()` from `session-start-hook.sh`** — uses shared `config()` instead.

### Tests

- 323 tests (up from 256), 99% coverage.

## [0.6.0] — Timezone fix, cross-platform, community contribution

### Fixed

- **Log filename date used UTC instead of configured timezone** ([#26](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/pull/26)) — `MEMORY_LOG_DATE` was computed before `REMEMBER_TZ` was defined; `TZ=""` silently falls back to UTC on macOS/BSD. Community contribution by [@josemoreno801-netizen](https://github.com/josemoreno801-netizen).
- **Marketplace path resolution in `log.sh`** — `PIPELINE_DIR` now used for `config.json` and `hooks.d` paths.
- **BSD `mktemp` compatibility** — no file extensions after `XXXXXX` template.
- **Windows / Git Bash portability** — centralized `SYS_TMPDIR`, `py` launcher fallback, session-dir slug matching.
- **Haiku header guard** — prevents invented `unknown` headers in summarization output.

### Added

- **`pipeline/_tz.py`** — shared timezone-aware date helpers for Python, reading `REMEMBER_TZ` with fallback to system local (never UTC).
- **`time_format` config option** — `24h` (default) or `12h` for AM/PM timestamps in log files.

### Tests

- 256 tests (up from 224), 99% coverage, `_tz.py` at 100%.

## [0.5.0] — Bug fixes, Python 3.9 support, DPT marketplace

### Added

- **DPT marketplace** — install from our own marketplace for reliable updates (`/plugin marketplace add Digital-Process-Tools/claude-marketplace`).
- **Python 3.9 support** — `from __future__ import annotations` in all pipeline modules (macOS ships 3.9 via CommandLineTools).

### Fixed

- **NDC subshell killed by `set -e`** ([#14](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/14)) — background compression no longer dies silently when `claude -p` returns non-zero.
- **`.gitignore` created too late** ([#17](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/17)) — now created in `session-start-hook.sh` before any save triggers.

### Tests

- 186 tests (up from 162), 99% coverage.

## [0.4.0] — Version tagging & marketplace update docs

### Added

- First release with proper git tags.

### Documentation

- Documented known marketplace update bugs with workarounds ([anthropics/claude-code#37252](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37252), [anthropics/claude-code#38271](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38271)).

## [0.3.0] — Path resolution overhaul

Fixes [#9](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/9), addresses [#10](https://github.com/Digital-Process-Tools/claude-remember/issues/10).

### Added

- **`resolve-paths.sh`** — single source of truth for all path resolution across local and marketplace installs.
- All hooks log their resolved paths to `.remember/logs/` on every invocation.
- Hook stderr captured to `.remember/logs/hook-errors.log` via `hooks.json` redirect.

### Changed

- Marketplace installs without `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` now **fail with a clear FATAL error** instead of silently computing wrong paths.

### Tests

- 162 tests (up from 122), including realistic plugin simulation tests for both install layouts.

## [0.2.0] — Windows compatibility, CLI v2.1.86+ support

### Fixed

- Path slugging for Windows backslashes and colons.
- UTF-8 encoding added to all Python file operations.
- Handle CLI v2+ JSON array response format in `haiku.py`.

## [0.1.0] — Initial release
